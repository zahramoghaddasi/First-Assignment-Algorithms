# First Assignment Warm-Up 📚

Welcome to your second assignment in the Advanced Programming course! This repository contains three medium to somewhat hard problems. The main goal of this assignment is to help you learn more advanced parts of Java syntax and put your problem-solving skills to the test.

## Getting Started 🚀

To get started with the assignments, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

3. Complete the tasks given in each assignment. The details and requirements for each assignment can be found as a comment block within their respective methods.

4. Once you have completed an assignment, commit your changes using the following commands:

   ```
   git add . or git add -A
   git commit -m "Completed Assignment <number>"
   ```

6. Push your changes to the remote repository using the following command:

   ```
   git push origin main
   ```

8. If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to create an issue in the repository or reach out to your mentor. 🤝

## Prerequisites ✅

- Basic knowledge of Java
  - Although it is not necessary to know in order to solve the problems, I advise you to also read about `Map<>` & `HashMap<>` in Java and use them in your solutions.
- Familiarity with Git and GitHub basics.

## Evaluation 📃
- Your code should compile and run without any errors
- Your code should pass all the unit tests included in the `src/test/java` directory.
- Your code should be well-organized, readable, properly commented and follows clean code principles
- You should use Git for version control and include meaningful commit messages

**Attention: Using ChatGPT or any other AI generative model for any section of the assignment will result in a score of 0 without any warnings.**
